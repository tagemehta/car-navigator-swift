- Object tracking will jump from one object of a class to another object of a class
  - Potential fix:
    - Verify object after a short delay
    - Check for big jumps in object location and handle
- error handling neeeds to be more robust.
- App is not chatty enough
  - It doesn't say searching when it starts searching or found when found
- Detections aren't as plentiful as in the yolo app. Check the camera configuration
- No unit or integration testing happening
